## 📅 WEEK 2: Reliability

### 1. Fix OAuth State Management (HIGH PRIORITY - 4 hours)
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started  
**Why:** In-memory dict lost on restart, users re-auth after every deploy  
**Files:** `services/auth/gpt_oauth.py`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `oauth_states` database table
- [ ] Move `_oauth_states` dict to database
- [ ] Add state expiration (30 min timeout)
- [ ] Add cleanup job for expired states
- [ ] Test OAuth flow with database
- [ ] Deploy and verify persistence

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- OAuth states survive server restarts
- Old states are cleaned up automatically
- No re-auth needed after deploys

---

### 2. Add Batch Deletion (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 3 hours)
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started  
**Why:** Safer than deleting all at once, better UX  
**Files:** `services/gmail_connector/api.py`, `GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Modify `apply_cleanup` to support batch size parameter
- [ ] Add progress tracking (deleted X/Y emails)
- [ ] Update GPT instructions to show progress
- [ ] Add "stop deletion" capability
- [ ] Test with large email batches
- [ ] Update OpenAPI schema

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Deletes in batches of 10-20 emails
- Shows progress: "Deleted 10/45..."
- User can stop mid-deletion
- All or nothing rollback on error

---

### 3. Better Error Messages (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 2 hours)
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started  
**Why:** Generic errors confuse users  
**Files:** All API files, `GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Map error codes to user-friendly messages
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Provide actionable guidance in errors
- [ ] Update GPT instructions with error responses
- [ ] Test error scenarios

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Errors explain what went wrong
- Errors suggest how to fix
- Transient errors auto-retry
- GPT displays helpful messages

## 📅 WEEK 3: Polish

### 1. Add Undo Feature (LOW PRIORITY - 4 hours)
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started  
**Why:** Safety net for mistakes  
**Files:** `services/gmail_connector/api.py`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Track last deletion batch (message IDs)
- [ ] Add `undoCleanup` endpoint
- [ ] Gmail API: move from Trash back to Inbox
- [ ] Update GPT instructions
- [ ] Time limit: 5 minutes after deletion

---

### 2. Add Basic Analytics (LOW PRIORITY - 3 hours)
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started  
**Why:** Show users their inbox trends  
**Files:** New `services/analytics/` module

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Track scans over time
- [ ] Aggregate sender statistics
- [ ] Calculate space saved
- [ ] Top spam senders
- [ ] Add `/analytics` endpoint

---

## 📅 WEEK 4+: Expansion

### Multi-Provider Support

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: When adding a new provider:**
1. ✅ Add configuration to `services/connectors/provider_config.py`
2. ✅ Run `./scripts/update_resilience_docs.sh` to generate docs
3. ✅ Update `RESILIENCE.md` with generated content
4. ✅ Test with provider-specific rate limits
5. ✅ Update `GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` if needed

**Providers to add:**
- [ ] Yahoo Mail integration
- [ ] Outlook/Microsoft 365 integration
- [ ] Google Drive cleanup
- [ ] Dropbox integration
- [ ] iCloud Mail & Drive
