## 📅 WEEK 2: Reliability

### 1. Fix OAuth State Management ✅ COMPLETED (Oct 19)
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Why:** In-memory dict lost on restart, users re-auth after every deploy  
**Files:** `services/auth/gpt_oauth.py`, `db/models.py`

**Completed:**
- [x] Create `oauth_states` database table
- [x] Move `_oauth_states` dict to database

- [x] Add cleanup job for expired states
- [x] Test OAuth flow with database

**Result:** OAuth states now survive server restarts! ✅

- User can stop mid-deletion
- All or nothing rollback on error

---

### 3. Better Error Messages (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 2 hours)
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started
