# Deklutter - Resilience & Error Handling

**Last Updated:** Oct 19, 2025

This document describes the resilience patterns and error handling strategies implemented in Deklutter.

## ⚙️ Provider-Specific Configuration

**All provider configurations are centralized in:** `services/connectors/provider_config.py`

Each provider (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) has different API limits and requirements. When adding a new provider:

1. ✅ Add configuration to `PROVIDER_CONFIGS` in `provider_config.py`
2. ✅ Run `python services/connectors/provider_config.py` to generate docs
3. ✅ Update this file with the generated section
4. ✅ Test with provider-specific limits

**Current Providers:** Gmail, Yahoo Mail (planned), Outlook (planned)

---

## 🛡️ Resilience Patterns Implemented

### **1. Circuit Breaker Pattern**

**Purpose:** Prevent cascading failures when Gmail API is down

**How it works:**
- **CLOSED** (normal): All requests go through
- **OPEN** (failing): Reject requests immediately after 5 failures
- **HALF_OPEN** (testing): After 60s timeout, allow test requests

**Configuration:**
```python
failure_threshold = 5    # Open after 5 failures
timeout = 60            # Wait 60s before retry
success_threshold = 2   # Need 2 successes to close
```

**Benefits:**
- Fails fast when service is down
- Prevents wasting resources on doomed requests
- Automatic recovery when service comes back
- Protects Gmail API from overload

**File:** `services/gmail_connector/circuit_breaker.py`

---

### **2. Exponential Backoff**

**Purpose:** Retry transient failures with increasing delays

**How it works:**
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: Wait 2 seconds
- Attempt 3: Wait 4 seconds
- Attempt 4: Wait 8 seconds

**Retry on:**
- ✅ 429 (Rate Limit)
- ✅ 500 (Server Error)
- ✅ 503 (Service Unavailable)
- ✅ Network errors

**Don't retry on:**
- ❌ 400 (Bad Request)
- ❌ 401 (Unauthorized)
- ❌ 403 (Forbidden)
- ❌ 404 (Not Found)

**Benefits:**
- Handles transient failures gracefully
- Reduces load on failing service
- Increases success rate

**File:** `services/gmail_connector/api.py` (`_retry_with_backoff`)

---

### **3. Rate Limiting**

**Purpose:** Respect Gmail API quotas

**Configuration:**
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 100           # Max 100 requests per batch
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 0.1     # 100ms between batches
MAX_EMAILS_PER_SCAN = 1000 # Cap per scan
```

**Gmail API Limits:**
- 1 billion quota units/day
- 250 quota units/second/user
- messages.list: 5 units
- messages.get: 5 units

**Benefits:**
- Prevents hitting rate limits
- Smooth, predictable performance
- Fair usage of shared resource

---

### **4. Batch API Requests**

**Purpose:** Reduce API calls and improve performance

**How it works:**
- Fetch up to 100 email metadata in single batch request
- Reduces 10,000 API calls → 100 batch calls (100x improvement!)

**Benefits:**
- **Faster:** 100x fewer API calls
- **Cheaper:** 100x fewer quota units
- **More reliable:** Fewer network round-trips

**File:** `services/gmail_connector/api.py` (lines 135-175)

---

### **5. Graceful Degradation**

**Purpose:** Continue working even when some operations fail

**Examples:**
- If 1 email in batch fails → continue with rest
- If 1 batch fails → continue with next batch
- Abort only after 3+ consecutive batch failures

**Benefits:**
- Better user experience
- Partial success better than total failure
- Resilient to intermittent issues

---

### **6. Comprehensive Logging**

**Purpose:** Debug issues and monitor health

**What we log:**
```python
logger.info()    # Normal operations (scan started, completed)
logger.warning() # Retries, partial failures
logger.error()   # Failures, circuit breaker opens
```

**Logged information:**
- User ID (for debugging)
- Operation name
- Retry attempts
- Error details
- Circuit breaker state changes
- Batch progress

**Benefits:**
- Easy debugging
- Performance monitoring
- Audit trail
- Early warning of issues

## 📊 Error Handling Flow

```
User Request
    ↓
Circuit Breaker Check
    ↓ (if OPEN)
    └→ Return "Service Unavailable" (fast fail)
    ↓ (if CLOSED/HALF_OPEN)
API Call with Retry
    ↓ (if transient error)
    ├→ Retry with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
    ↓ (if persistent error)
    ├→ Circuit breaker opens after 5 failures
    ↓ (if success)
    └→ Circuit breaker records success
```

---

## 🔍 Error Messages (User-Facing)

### **Circuit Breaker Open**
```json
{
  "error": "service_unavailable",
  "message": "Gmail API is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a minute."
}
```

### **Scan Failed**
```json
{
  "error": "scan_failed",
  "message": "Failed to fetch email list. Please try again."
}
```

### **Cleanup Failed**
```json
{
  "error": "cleanup_failed",
  "message": "Failed to delete some emails. Please try again."
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Resilience

### **Simulate Failures:**
```python
# Test circuit breaker
for i in range(6):
    try:
        scan_recent(user, 30, 100, db)
    except:
        pass  # Circuit should open after 5 failures

# Test exponential backoff
# (Mock Gmail API to return 503)
```

### **Monitor Circuit Breaker:**
```python
from services.gmail_connector.circuit_breaker import gmail_circuit_breaker

state = gmail_circuit_breaker.get_state()
print(state)
# {
#   "name": "gmail_api",
#   "state": "closed",
#   "failure_count": 0,
#   "success_count": 0,
#   "opened_at": null
# }
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- 10,000 emails = 10,000 API calls
- ~50,000 quota units
- ~2-3 minutes scan time
- No retry logic
- No circuit breaker

### **After Optimizations:**
- 10,000 emails = ~100 batch calls
- ~500 quota units (100x improvement!)
- ~10-15 seconds scan time (10x faster!)
- 3 retries with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker protection

- [ ] Metrics dashboard (Prometheus/Grafana)
- [ ] Adaptive rate limiting
- [ ] Request queuing for burst traffic
- [ ] Health check endpoint

### **Nice to Have:**
- [ ] Bulkhead pattern (isolate failures)
- [ ] Timeout configuration per operation
- [ ] Fallback strategies
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests
